**Cub3D** is a 3D graphical project developed as part of the curriculum at [42 School](https://42.fr/).  
It recreates a classic raycasting engine like that in *Wolfenstein 3D*, transforming a simple 2D map into a real-time 3D first-person experience — built entirely in C using the MiniLibX graphics library.


> 🛠️ **Built with:** C, MiniLibX (X11), Linux  
> 🎮 **Goal:** Create a 3D-like game experience from scratch with low-level tools  
> 💡 **Key Concepts:** Raycasting, real-time rendering, vector math, player control, texture mapping

## 🚀 Features

- 🔭 **Raycasting Engine**
  - DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm to detect wall collisions
  - Perspective projection for depth simulation

- 🧱 **Wall Rendering**
  - Texture support for all directions (North, South, East, West)
  - Accurate texture mapping

- 📜 **Map Parsing & Validation**
  - Parses `.cub` files with textures, floor/ceiling colors, and layout
  - Validates player position, map closure, and identifier correctness

- 👤 **Player Movement**
  - `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` for movement
  - Arrow keys for smooth rotation
  - Collision detection

- 🎨 **Floor & Ceiling Colors**
  - Customizable RGB values from `.cub` file

- 🗺️ **Minimap (Bonus)**
  - Displays player position and field of view
  - Updates in real time

- 🚪 **Doors & Animations (Bonus)**
  - Interactive elements like doors or animated textures
